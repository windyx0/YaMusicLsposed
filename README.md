**YaMusicLsposed** is an Xposed/LSPosed module that adds music downloading capabilities and advanced features to the official Yandex Music application. The module works entirely "under the hood" and integrates seamlessly into the app's UI with a stunning Liquid Glass design.

## Features

* **Direct MP3 Download**: Download individual tracks, entire albums, or playlists in original quality.
* **Embedded Metadata & Covers**: Tracks are saved with correct ID3 tags (Title, Artist, Album) and high-quality album art embedded.
* **Parallel Downloading**: Super-fast playlist downloads using multiple threads.
* **Playlist Sorting**: The module smartly manipulates file creation dates so that when sorting files by "Date Added" in your player, they align perfectly with the original playlist order.
* **Liquid Glass UI**: Premium settings and overlay menus built with Jetpack Compose featuring a translucent glass effect, fluid animations, and native back gesture support.
* **Active Downloads Monitor**: A convenient real-time tracker showing the progress of each individual track currently being downloaded.
